<h1>1 Overview</h1>
<p>In this exercise, we are required to select one of the module of your proposed Shiny application and complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To evaluate and determine the necessary R packages needed for your Shiny application are supported in R CRAN,</p></li>
<li><p>To prepare and test the specific R codes can be run and returned the correct output as expected,</p></li>
<li><p>To determine the parameters and outputs that will be exposed on the Shiny applications, and</p></li>
<li><p>To select the appropriate Shiny UI components for exposing the parameters determine above.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="project-information" class="level1">
<h1>2 Project Information</h1>
<p>In this project, we will analyze weather across different areas in Singapore and build an interactive R Shiny application. The application will consists of four sections :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Homepage tab</strong>: Users have an overview of the dataset used in application. It will include a map of Singapore and interactivity elements that allow users to view the dataset at different points in time.</li>
<li><strong>EDA and CDA tab</strong>: Users can explore the distribution and trends in the dataset for specific periods or locations (station or region), and use statistical analysis to confirm the trends.</li>
<li><strong>Time series analysis</strong>: Users can explore the time series decomposition of the different variables, and select the type of model that they would like to use for univariate time series forecasting.</li>
<li><strong>Clustering time series analysis</strong>: Users can explore grouping stations with similar weather patterns or grouping time periods with similar patterns. The user would then be able to choose different models to forecast the grouped data.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this exercise, we will focus on the second module.</p>
