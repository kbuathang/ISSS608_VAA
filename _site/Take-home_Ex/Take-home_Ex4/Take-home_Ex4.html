<h1>1 Overview</h1>
<p>In this exercise, we are required to select one of the module of your proposed Shiny application and complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To evaluate and determine the necessary R packages needed for your Shiny application are supported in R CRAN,</p></li>
<li><p>To prepare and test the specific R codes can be run and returned the correct output as expected,</p></li>
<li><p>To determine the parameters and outputs that will be exposed on the Shiny applications, and</p></li>
<li><p>To select the appropriate Shiny UI components for exposing the parameters determine above.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="project-information" class="level1">
<h1>2 Project Information</h1>
<p>In this project, we will analyze weather across different areas in Singapore and build an interactive R Shiny application.</p>
<p>For this exercise, we will focus on <strong>EDA and CDA tab</strong> where users can explore the distribution and trends in the dataset for specific periods or locations (station or region), and use statistical analysis to confirm the trends.</p>
