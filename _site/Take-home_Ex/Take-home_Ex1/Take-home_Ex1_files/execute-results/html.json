If they are, then they will be launched into R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, ggrepel, patchwork,ggplot2, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,dplyr,tidyr,knitr,ggridges)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3.2 Importing Data\n\nThe 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data released on December 5, 2022 will be used. PISA global education survey every three years to assess the education systems worldwide through testing 15 year old students in the subjects of mathematics, reading, and science.\n\nThe code chunk below uses [`read_sas()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html) of [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/index.html) to import PISA data into R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nstu_qqq <- read_sas(\"data/cy08msp_stu_qqq.sas7bdat\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Filtering data\n\nFilter Singaporean data by using [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html#useful-filter-functions)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nstu_qqq_SG <- stu_qqq %>%\n  filter(CNT == \"SGP\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Selecting variables\n\nThe code chunk below uses [`select()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html) to include selected variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nstu_qqq_SG_v2 <- stu_qqq_SG %>%\n  select(CNTSTUID,PV1MATH,PV1READ,PV1SCIE,STRATUM,ST004D01T,ESCS) %>%\n  rename(STUDENT_ID=CNTSTUID,\n         MATH=PV1MATH,\n         READING=PV1READ,\n         SCIENCE=PV1SCIE,\n         SCHOOL=STRATUM,\n         SOCIOECONOMIC_STATUS=ESCS,\n         GENDER=ST004D01T)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-Note\nAccording to [OECD](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/pisa-data-analysis-manual-sas-second-edition_9789264056251-en#page1), it stated that single plausible value can be used to analzye in the exploratory phase of the data. Using one or five plausible values will not make any significant difference.

Students with higher socioeconomic status tend to achieve better scores. This demonstrates a positive correlation between socioeconomic status and scores. In other words, students from more advantaged backgrounds tend to perform better.\n\nThe density ridges plots show that students with more advantaged socioeconomic status cluster around higher score ranges, while those with less advantaged socioeconomic status tend to cluster around lower score ranges. This reaffirms that socioeconomic advantages are associated with better academic outcome.\n:::\n\n# 6 Conclusion\n\nIn summary,our analysis reveal some key findings. Across all three subjects, there is a similarity in score distributions. However, math consistently achieve the highest scores, while reading tends to have lowest. Additionally, female students tend to have around similar scores, while male students have greater score variability. While private schools tend to have slightly better average scores, public schools have a broader range of scores. This indicates that there is more variation in how well students in public schools perform. Lastly, the most observation is positive correlation between socioeconomic status and academic performance. Students from more advantaged backgrounds consistently achieve better scores.\n\nRecommendation for the further investigation is to include a long term study which involve following a specific group of students from a particular point in time, such as from elementary school and collecting data on their academic performance at multiple points in their educational journey. This will provide more comprehensive insights and reveal the trend that may not appear in a short term study.\n",
